            <h2>game overview</h2>
            <p>It’s late summer in the remote forests of upstate New York, and the teen counselors of
                Hackett’s Quarry have the camp to themselves for one final night. That means no kids,
                no adults, and no rules. In this thrilling cinematic tale, you control the fates of all nine
                camp counselors as their party plans unravel into an unpredictable night of horror. With
                life-or-death decisions around every turn, the choices you make will determine how the
                story unfolds. <br><br>
                In this game you're in control of this cinematic teen horror story. Every decision you
                make and action you take affects how this thriller unfolds.
            </p>

            <h3>“THEIR LIVES, YOUR DECISIONS”</h3>
            <p>Play as all nine of the Hackett's Quarry camp counselors over the course of the game. As
                their end-of-summer plans unravel into a night of unpredictable horror, you'll be faced
                with a multitude of decisions. Every yell, lie, and flirtation you choose affects the
                counselors’ relationships and each action has a ripple effect on the story. Ultimately, you
                determine who’s alive, who’s dead, and who's "stronger" by the time the credits roll.

                mysterious goings-on. <br><br>
            
            </p>

            <h2>reception</h2>
            <p>The Quarry received "generally favorable" reviews for Microsoft Windows and Xbox
                Series X and "mixed or average" reviews for PlayStation 5, according to review
                aggregator Metacritic. <br><br>
                Destructoid stated that The Quarry successfully replicated what made its predecessors
                unique and praised its ability to "fluctuate between tension, drama, and levity", while
                writing, "These games are at their best when they leverage classic horror while also
                infusing some modern touches, meta moments, and well-timed laughs..." Game Informer
                lamented the limited player agency but praised the quality of the "enthralling" choices and
                engaging narrative. GameRevolution thought highly of the title's character development,
                graphical quality, Movie Mode, and branching narrative design, but felt that the
                exploration mode was slow and that its camera was claustrophobic. GamesRadar+ thought
                that its slow beginning, frequent pacing issues, and excessively large cast of characters
                hindered the game, but that some engaging plot points, quality voicework, and good
                graphics somewhat alleviated these issues. GameSpot praised the game's snappy dialogue,
                ensemble cast, love for horror movies, and the "palpable sense of weight behind many
                choices” but criticized the glacial walking speed of the exploration and the narrative's
                pacing issues. <br><br>
                IGN favored the script, cast, and various narrative climaxes, but disliked the lack of player
                interactivity and the absence of quality-of-life features, concluding, "The Quarry is worth
                playing at least once, but when compared to Until Dawn, it's one step forward and one
                step back." PC Gamer felt that while the title retained the strengths of the developer's
                previous games, it only showed marks of improvement through its production values, and
                stated, "The plot, performances and visual fidelity are worth turning up for, as are some
                of the shocks, but more than ever much of your involvement seems like protective padding
                sandwiched between the scripted thrills." Shacknews gave high praise to the dynamically
                branching storylines, unique characters, homages to classic horror, and solid scares, but
                took minor issue with the fixed camera creating some awkward moments and the inability
                to fast-forward on repeat playthroughs. The Guardian gave it 4 out of 5 stars, writing,
                "The Quarry’s charming writing and cinematic presentation make it an engrossing horror
                caper – even if this is, paradoxically, a game that’s often at its best when you’re not
                actively playing it." <br><br>
